## Installation

1. Install the dotfiles from [gh0stzk's repository](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles) OR just install dependencies
2. Copy and paste my files, replacing the existing ones.

   **Note:** This setup requires manual edits. Itâ€™s not a simple plug-and-play solution.

### Manual Edits Required

- **Weather Script**: Change your location/city and generate an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for the weather script. The weather display shows the actual weather and is clickable to open another app.
- **Keyboard Layouts**: Update the keyboard layouts you use in the keyboard switch script.
- Probably other small tweaks I already forgot
  
## Highlights

- **Theme Changes**: Custom visual enhancements for a unique look.
- **Arch News Notification**: Polybar notification showing the latest Arch news, which turns invisible when clicked. If manual intervention is needed, the notification will show exclamation marks.
- **Redshift**: Screen color adjustment for reduced eye strain.
- **Keyboard Switch**: Easily switch between keyboard layouts.
- **Calendar**: A slightly modified version of the existing calendar from the original dotfiles.
- **Clickable Weather**: Displays actual weather info (requires `wttr` installed), and is clickable to open another app.
- **Flatpak Updates**: Notifies you of Flatpak updates as part of the existing update system.
- **Audio Limit to 100%**: Prevents audio from exceeding 100%.
- **Audio Management**: Use `Super + G` for audio controls (similar to `Win + G` on Windows), even in games.
- **Small Tweaks**: Various minor customizations and enhancements.

...and more!
